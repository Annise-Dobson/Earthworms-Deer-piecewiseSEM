Species: Plant Species including Actaea pachypoda (Actaea), Aquilegia canadensis (Aquilegia), Cornus racemosa (Cornus), Quercus rubra (Quercus), Prenanthes alba (Prenanthes)
Worm: Earthworm presence (1) or absence (0) in plot
Deer: Earthworm access (1) or exclusion (0) in plot
Standard.exchange.P.20: Extractable soil P pools in the top 20cm of the soil profile (g mw<sup>-2</sup>)
Standard.Total.P.20: Total soil P pools in the top 20cm of the soil profile (g mw<sup>-2</sup>)
SoilN: Total % N of A horizon soil
Dry.Year.gm2: Dry earthworm biomass per area (g m<sup>-2</sup>)
P.Exch.Conc: Concentration of extractable P in the A horizon (w w<sup>-1</sup>)
P.Total.Conc:Concentration of total P in the A horizon (w w<sup>-1</sup>)
Height: Initial height of seedlings at planting
Dry.mass.above: Dry biomass of plant aboveground tissue (g)
Survival: Plot-level survival
L.4.L: Length of roots <0.25 mm in diameter divided by total root length

Vesicles:% of roots with vesicles present
Coil:% of roots with hyphal coils present
DSE: % of roots with Dark Septate Endophytes present
DSE.binomial: Presence (1) or absence (0) of DSE
All.Mycorhizae: % of roots with arbuscules and/or hyphal coils present
Arb.Ves	: Number of arbuscules divided by number of vesicles
